DataFrame API发挥作用的地方：通过为pandas提供一个包装器，可以智能的将巨大的DataFrame分隔成更小的片段，并将它们分散到多个worker(帧)中，**并存储在磁盘中而不是RAM中**。\n","\n","Dask DataFrame会被分割成多个部门，每个部分称之为一个分区，每个分区都是一个相对较小的DataFrame，可以分配给任意的worker，并在需要复制时维护其完整数据。具体操作就是**对每个分区并行**或单独操作(多个机器的话也可以并行)，然后再将结果合并，其实从直观上也能推出Dask肯定是这么做的。"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"3e75df6c","metadata":{"id":"3e75df6c"},"outputs":[],"source":["#
